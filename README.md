# Discussion report
# Go to Kisumu Token Replacements
To refine our prototype language Kisumu, we have systematically replaced the original Golang tokens and syntax with Kisumu equivalents. This ensures our language maintains a unique identity while providing familiar constructs for users transitioning from Golang. Below is a comprehensive list of these replacements.
# Data Types

    int -> digit
    string -> sent
    rune -> char
    float64 -> deci64
    float32 -> deci32
    bool -> booly
    byte -> bite

# Control Structures

    main -> core
    if -> if case
    else -> otherwise
    for -> loop
    switch -> option
    case -> option case
    default -> default case
    return -> return
    break -> exit
    continue -> next

# Functions and Methods

    func -> method
    print -> display
    println -> displayln
     printf -> displayf

# Declarations

    var -> declare
    const -> constant
    type -> define

# Operators(the symbols are  retained and will be used  in our language as defined below)

    + -> add
    - -> subtract
    * -> multiply
    / -> divide
    = -> assign
    == -> equals
    != -> not equals
    > -> greater than
    < -> less than
    >= -> greater or equal
    <= -> less or equal
    && -> and
    || -> or
    ! -> not
    ++ -> increment
    -- -> decrement
    += -> add assign
    -= -> subtract assign
    *= -> multiply assign
    /= -> divide assign
    % -> modulus

# Error Handling

    error -> mistake
    panic -> crisis

# Miscellaneous
    package -> pack
    import -> bring
    defer -> delay
    select -> choose
    chan -> channel
    interface -> face
    struct -> structure
    map -> mapping
    range -> iterate

# Problems encountered

1. Token Consistency: Ensuring all instances of Golang tokens are correctly and uniformly replaced with Kisumu equivalents.
2. Syntax and Semantics: Maintaining the intended meaning and functionality of language constructs while changing their names.
